.SH NAME
LTools - a set of useful productivity command-line tools

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B LTools
are a set of small but useful free, open-source productivity-enhancing
command-line tools for UNIX, Linux and similar open-source operating
systems.  They embrace the UNIX philosophy in that many of them are
intended to be used as part of pipes that read from standard input and
write to standard output streams, and that they combined so the output
of one can be the input to another. Thus, they are also
interoperatable with existing UNIX/Linux commands, whether they are
built in or user-contributed.

Note that some of them name-clash with existing commands depending on
the host operating system. Therefore, order in the PATH environment
variable matters, and as a resolution mechanism, the LTools installer
also installs variants prefixed by "l" (e.g. spell(1) is also
available as lspell(1)).

.SH HISTORY

Some LTools were originally started as simple programming exercises
when the author wanted to learn and play/experiment with the Rust
programming language, and in the month of February 2021, being between
two jobs, Jochen Leidner developed a bunch more and bundled them for
an initial 1.0.0 release.  It is hoped that folks find them useful,
and consider contributing, too.

.SH EXAMPLE
.VERBON
$ man ltools
.VERBOFF
